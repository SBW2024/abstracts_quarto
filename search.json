    "section": "",
    "text": "ABSTRACT:\nResearch Infrastructures (RI) play a pivotal role in advancing scientific discovery and innovation by providing specialized technologies, expertise, and resources to the research community. In recent years, RIs have become integral components across all research fields, supporting a wide range of projects and initiatives aimed at addressing complex scientific challenges. However, despite their importance, the career path and professional development opportunities available to RI staff have often been overlooked, leading to challenges in recruitment, staff retention, and career progression within these vital institutions.\nRecognizing the need for tailored career pathways for RI experts, several institutions, both nationally and internationally, have taken proactive steps to address this issue. In Sweden, the Karolinska Institute, Chalmers University of Technology, and other leading institutions have made significant strides in developing career paths for RI staff. However, challenges remain, including the lack of standardized frameworks and clear pathways for career progression within RIs.\nIn response to these challenges, we propose a Generic RI Career Framework that can be implemented across RIs nationwide. By recognizing and formalizing the expertise and contributions of RI staff, this framework aims to enhance career development opportunities, facilitate mobility between RIs, and ensure the sustainability of these essential research assets. By outlining clear career tracks, expertise tiers, and job titles, this framework provides a structured approach to career progression within RIs. By investing in the professional development of RI staff, we can strengthen the research infrastructure ecosystem, foster innovation, and drive scientific progress for the benefit of society."

    "section": "",
    "text": "ABSTRACT:\nThe project builds upon an earlier deep neural network model developed for deriving a low-dimensional representation of SNP data. This can be used to perform feature selection for downstream models as well as to identify and visualize population structure. The most common approach relies on PCA components, but it has shortcomings such as linearity and sensitivity to outliers. In contrast, our model, being nonlinear and data-driven, has been shown to produce more informative embeddings.\nSo far the model has been adapted to training on large datasets and trained on SNP data from UK Biobank, which has one of the most comprehensive databases of human genotypes and phenotypes to date. After these first training attempts, the model is now being improved and tuned. Further plans include applying other deep learning methods to UK Biobank, such as contrastive learning, and extending the model with phenotype prediction capabilities to aid genome-wide association studies."

    "section": "",
    "text": "ABSTRACT:\n“Middle-aged women are 2-3 times more likely than men to develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) later in life. While women tend to live longer, factors like sex hormones, genetics, and environment heighten their AD risk. Understanding sex differences in AD has been complex. This project aimed to uncover the molecular underpinnings of the female sex hormone estrogen in AD models and relate these findings to human disease.\nWe investigated the role of biological sex and sex hormones in AD pathology using APPNLGF mice by inducing surgical menopause in young adult female mice and castrating male mice. APPNLGF mice, which exhibit clear AD pathology by 6 months of age, were used to study the effects of biological sex and sex hormones on memory and AD pathology at 6 and 12 months.\nPreliminary data indicated that the estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) exerts neuroprotective effects in APPNLGF mice. Consequently, we crossed ERβ-/- mice with APP-KI mice to study the effects of ERβ loss on AD pathology, utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing of hippocampal brain cell populations. This analysis provided insights into ERβ’s role in brain cell functions and identified sex-dependent alterations in gene activity.\nWe will anchor our findings to human disease by studying gene and pathway regulations in human AD brains and analyzing GWAS data from women with or without AD diagnosis and with or without different menopausal hormonal treatments.\nCollectively, these findings offer insights into mechanisms underlying sex-specific susceptibility to AD and identify regulatory proteins for potential treatments targeting sex-dependent AD pathology.”"

    "title": "Genome-scale metabolic modeling identifies sites at risk for metabolism-induced promotion of cancer-associated muscle atrophy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "ABSTRACT:\nCCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) is a transcription factor involved in normal tissue development, while also associated with poor prognosis in cancer due to upregulation of inflammatory pathways that lead to cancer cachexia, i.e. muscle atrophy. We recently identified 2-hydroxybutyrate as a novel metabolic signal capable of stimulating C/EBPβ activity in tumour cells. We hypothesized that we could replicate this mechanism as a signature in large datasets to identify cancers most at risk for metabolism-induced C/EBPβ-dependent promotion of cancer cachexia.\nWe first conducted a transcriptome-wide Cox proportional hazards regression model screen for all tumour sites included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets, outputting genes associated with poor outcome by tumour site. These genes were assessed for enrichment in C/EBPβ regulated genes according to both public unbiased and curated gene sets. TCGA samples were subsequently clustered within tumour sites based on C/EBPβ gene sets predicting poor outcome in those sites. Prediction of patient outcome was confirmed by survival analysis comparing resultant sample clusters.\nFinally, we conducted genome scale metabolic modelling comparing C/EBPβ clusters that successfully predicted outcome. Metabolic models assessed capacity for production of 2-hydroxybutyrate, as well as NADH and NADPH as indicators of redox balance that feed into C/EBPβ stimulation. We find that head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, low grade gliomas, and lung squamous cell carcinoma are at greatest risk for 2-hydroxybutyrate driven C/EBPβ-dependent expression of pro-cachexia factors in solid tumours. This work provides guidance for further laboratory-based investigation in this field."

    "title": "Comparative study of recent contact zone of tree species in Scandinavia",
    "section": "",
    "text": "ABSTRACT:\nThe Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~18,000 ya) strongly shaped the current species distribution across Europe. During the LGM, large ice sheets were present over much of northern Europe, thus species survived in isolated areas known as refugia, located south or east of the ice sheet. As the climate improved and the ice retreated, individuals from various refugia recolonized Northern Europe, forming large contact zones. A previous study showed that Swedish populations of Norway spruce (Picea abies) form two major genetic clusters reflecting post-glacial colonization of Scandinavia from both a Southern and a Northern route. The contact zone separating these two genetic clusters in Spruce also aligned with a transition of Scandinavia’s two major climatic zones and is actively maintained by selection.\nWe are extending the study of this Scandinavian contact zone to silver birch (Betula pendula) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Genomic data were analyzed to explore the genetic structure of populations distributed along a latitudinal gradient. Like Norway spruce, southern and northern populations formed two distinct genetic clusters with a narrow contact zone between latitudes 60°- 63°N. The extent and geographical position of these contact zones, combined with information on thousands of genetic markers, allow the reconstruction of the divergence history of populations and the rate of adaptation of species to past climate shifts. Lastly, studying contact zones and genetic structure is paramount to avoid inaccuracy when implementing complex breeding strategies based on genomic prediction or predicting the future evolution of natural populations under current climate change."

    "section": "",
    "text": "ABSTRACT:\nCrude oil and petroleum products are of specific concern in pollution studies due to their structural complexity, slow biodegradability, biomagnification potential, and the serious health hazards associated with their release into the environment. Bioremediation, which makes use of natural microbial biodegradation activity, is an attractive alternative and/or addition to physicochemical methods for restoration of PHC polluted environments. For the development of effective bioremediation methods, a better understanding of the indigenous microbial community that use these compounds as an energy resource in the polluted areas is needed.\nIn this project, microbial community samples were collected in the underground mining facility in Kiruna underground mine (KUJ), in Lappland, Sweden, which is contaminated with pollutants due to the use of petroleum products for maintenance of machinery.\nMicrobial communities were characterized using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics of water and sediment samples collected throughout KUJ and the outflowing water from its tailing ponds, to describe the diversity of the indigenous microbial community and the expression of PHC degrading genes. Further, water samples were collected for characterization of the chemical reactivity of contaminants. Our aim with this project is to describe the microbial community diversity and activity in KUJ.\nThis project will build the foundation for developing local in situ bioremediation of KUJ."

    "section": "",
    "text": "ABSTRACT:\nHigh-solid anaerobic digestion (HSD) is a promising technology for production of biogas and concentrated biofertiliser from organic material with low water content. This study investigated a thermophilic HSD process operated in a laboratory-scale reactor of plug-flow type (PFR), which was given additional protein in the substrate mix to deliberately increase the ammonia concentration and trigger a stress response. As elevated ammonia levels is a common issue in thermophilic HSD, the aim was to explore which microbial groups that remain active under these conditions. Additionally, differences in microbial population, function and activity along the PFR’s horizontal axis was investigated to assess whether this reactor design could reduce the risk of severe ammonia-induced disturbances. These questions were studied using 16S rRNA gene sequences, metagenome and metatranscriptome data, processed with a combination of the Nextflow (nf-core) pipelines MAG, RNAseq and Metatdenovo.\nPreliminary results showed that no significant separation of the microbial community structure was observed along the reactor’s horizontal axis. However, the metatranscriptome data indicated downregulation in overall gene expression near the outlet, although class Thermotogae (Defluviitoga) remained relatively active in that section. The protein addition caused accumulation of volatile fatty acids, especially propionate, but the concentration decreased rapidly after protein addition ceased, indicating that no severe disturbance occurred. Propionate production was possibly linked to the genera Lentimicrobium and Proteiniphilum (class Bacteroidia), which showed higher activity during the protein addition phase. Genes expressed by Clostridia were clearly downregulated during the peak in ammonia concentration, while Thermotogae was relatively unaffected."

    "title": "The lac repressor considers inducibility when balancing search speed to binding stability",
    "section": "",
    "text": "ABSTRACT:\nTranscription factors (TFs) must efficiently locate specific DNA sequences among a large excess of non-specific sites while maintaining high binding specificity, a challenge known as the speed-stability paradox. Traditional views held that DNA specificity arises primarily from slow dissociation at target sites. However, our recent finding suggest that the probability of association is the main factor in governing specificity. Despite these advances, the mechanisms balancing search efficiency with binding stability remain unclear. To address this, we investigated the role of conformational switching between non-specific search and specific recognition modes in the LacI protein on its DNA binding dynamics.\nUsing molecular dynamics simulations and in vitro real-time kinetics measurements, we examined LacI variants with hinge region mutations that bias the protein toward either the search or recognition conformation. The V52A-LacI variant, which favors the recognition conformation, showed slower dissociation rates and reduced specificity. In contrast, the Q55N-LacI variant, favoring the search conformation, exhibited faster dissociation rates and increased specificity. These results were consistent across in vitro assays, molecular simulations, and in vivo single-molecule imaging, which confirmed the expected trade-offs between binding stability and specificity.\nOur findings demonstrate that a more flexible hinge helix in LacI mutants enhances its selectivity but reduces binding strength, while a more stable hinge helix has the opposite effect. The impact of search kinetics on the changes in specificity is however lower than expected. Instead the additional constraint on LacI to be able to allosterically change confirmation in response to an inducer limits the stability of the recognition confirmation, i.e. the trade-off is in stability vs inducibility rather than speed."

    "text": "Introduction: Multidrug resistance exhibited by extended-spectrum ß-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia Coli (E. coli) has been associated with antibiotic therapy failure. For effective infection control, it is imperative that ESBL-producing E. coli is well-surveilled. We thus investigate if wastewater metagenomics be used for surveillance of antimicrobial resistant E. coli.\nMethods: Influent wastewater was collected monthly between June 2023 and February 2024 from a large Uppsala treatment plant. Illumina sequencing was performed on pooled E. coli colonies produced from direct plating on selective Agar plates for E. coli (EC) and ESBL-producing E. coli (ESBL-EC). Relative abundance estimates of strains within the metagenomic sequences were computed through Kraken2 and Bracken. Sequences were also analysed for known antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) obtained from ResFinder.\nResults: A higher average E. coli abundance of 70.49% was detected for samples with ESBL-EC selection (n=15), compared to 69.47% with EC selection (n=16). Across the 7 samples reporting an E. coli abundance exceeding 80%, Escherichia Coli O157:H7 was consistently reported within the top 5 most highly abundant strains. Uropathogenic E. coli strains of serogroups O7, O16, O18 and O25 were also present. A preliminary analysis of 4 samples reported the highest prevalence of blaTEM genes, with either blaCTX-M or blaCMY following.\nConclusion: A known food and waterborne pathogen, Escherichia Coli O157:H7 is the cause of diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis and has historically been identified in cattle wastewater. Its presence in Uppsala wastewater thus requires further investigation. Additionally, the identification of blaCTX-M-genes, the most clinically occurring ESBL-genes, supports the above-described pipeline for E. coli surveillance. **"
