abstract: "FunCoup v6 (https://funcoup.org/) represents a significant advancement in global functional association networks, aiming to provide researchers with a comprehensive view of the functional coupling interactome. This update introduces novel methodologies and integrated tools for improved network inference and analysis. Major new developments in FunCoup v6 include vastly expanding the coverage of gene regulatory links, a new framework for bin-free Bayesian training, and a new website. A substantial increase in regulatory links was obtained for 13 species, with around half a million directed links between 838 transcription factors and 14,989 target genes only within the human network, enhancing our understanding of transcriptional regulation. In addition to MaxLink, FunCoup v6 integrates a new tool for disease and drug target module identification using the TOPAS algorithm. To expand the utility of the resource for biomedical research, it incorporates KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using the ANUBIX, BinoX, and EASE algorithms. The unique comparative interactomics analysis in FunCoup provides insights of network conservation, now allowing users to align orthologs only or query each species network independently. Bin-free training was applied to 22 primary species in FunCoup v6, and in addition networks were generated for all remaining 618 species in InParanoidDB 9 via a new ortholog-based method to transfer entire networks from the closest primary species. Accompanying these advancements, FunCoup v6 features a new redesigned website, together with updated API functionalities, providing users with enhanced accessibility and usability. FunCoup v6 demonstrates superior benchmark performance compared to other large functional association networks. "
