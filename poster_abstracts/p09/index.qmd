abstract: "A decade of massive sequencing efforts has revealed that copy number variations are pervasive in eukaryotic genomes. Among them, gene copy number variations (gCNVs) have received limited attention – in part due to past technological limitations – and their evolutionary importance remains to be understood. Open evolutionary questions include gCNV mutation rates, segregation patterns and recombination rates. In a previous study, we identified gCNVs across 25 Brassicaceae species with comparative genomics. Using this knowledge, we have designed crosses in an experimental evolutionary context to take a closer look at target gCNVs (e.g. segregation pattern, change in overall mean copy number, change in variance) using the small flowering Brassicaceae plant *Capsella rubella* as a model."
